You have been imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit!
You have but one chance at freedom and a new life.
You can choose to play a game with the executioner.
They say:
"Guess my secret word and you will be set free"
"I will even give you some gold if that will help thee"
"Select a list of words and difficulty to play"
"Choose too hard and you'll be left hanging this day"
"The harder you make it, the more gold you could earn"
"Immortalised in history, your name we will burn"
"The rules are simple, just guess a single letter"
"If it's part of the word it will appear for the better"
"Choose poorly though and your one step closer to death"
"Too many wrong, and you'll have taken your last breath"
"Win or lose, you're the master of your own fate"
"Win it quickly and the reward will be great."
